SoftDev best practices is organising an issue bonanza to improve (4 Open Source ) 4OSS lesson content on 10-12 of October. The Issue Bonanza will help us identify issues that need fixing before publication. Once we know what those issues are, the next step is to fix them! You donâ€™t need to be an expert in the materials - we need people to help search for broken links and typos too! And also remember that contribution to issue bonanza also counts for Hacktoberfest achievements. https://github.com/SoftDev4Research/4OSS-lesson
