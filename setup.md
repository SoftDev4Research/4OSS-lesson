In order to be prepared for the lesson, you need to have accounts to the following (free) services:

1. GitHub

If you don't already have a [GitHub](https://github.com/) account, please follow the guide [here](https://services.github.com/on-demand/intro-to-github/create-github-account) in order to create one.

2. BioTools

[bio.tools](https://bio.tools/) is a portal to bioinformatics resources worldwide, aimed to help bioinformaticians and scientists, find, understand, compare and select resources as well as use and connect them in workflows.

For the purposes of this lesson, we will be using the [**developer** instance of bio.tools](https://dev.bio.tools/) so that we can add test content (it is removed periodically).
