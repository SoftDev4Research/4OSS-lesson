## Communication

Let's now talk about transparent communication processes. There are several options available
to establish transparent communication with everyone involved in an open source project.
However, the choice of communication channel differs depending on the team size, which also
influences the frequency of communications.
For example, for a two-person project the means of communication
maybe only emails,
but a larger group may require a more advanced communication media that can archive
the past communications and allow search options.

> ## Discussion: Develop communication strategies
> #### Time: 5 minutes
> Let's discuss what types of communication media do people prefer. Think about the team size,
> and what would be most convenient way for people to communicate and get updates.
> You have 5 min to discuss, in groups.
>
> > ## Solution
> >
> > Here is a list of recommendations. However, the efficient solutions will
> > depend on the frequency of communication and the team size.
> > - Community calls/meetings
> > - Email list
> > - Slack
> > - Twitter
> > - GitHub issues
> > - Announcements (newsletters/updates)
> > - Archive

## Governance

> ## Challenge
> #### Time: 10 min
>
> Assign levels of priority needed in the project design and governance
> (choose one level per line and justify your choice)
>
>
> |---|---|---|---|---|
> |Topic|High|Medium|Low|Justify your choice|
> |About the project|||||
> |Ownership|||||
> |Roles and Responsibilities|||||
> |License|||||
> |Funding|||||
> |Timeline|||||
> |Outreach||||||
>
>
> > ## Solution
> >
> > Discussions among learners who chose different priorities will convince them of the need
> > for governance and transparency in open source projects. This will clarify the contributors' roles
> > and responsibilities within projects.
